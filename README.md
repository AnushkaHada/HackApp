# HackApp
2025 Community Hackathon Web App Dev Team!
Collaborators: 
Our project unlike others aims at a smaller community. As students at UCSC, we realized that clubs, events, and even tutoring can take up a lot of time, leading to conflicts in schedule. As such, our website unlike others aims to bring together this niche community filled with mostly college students and Santa Cruz affiliates, promoting interaction and an exchange of skills. Through this way our project stands out by providing a low effort way to get to know your fellow neighbors. Other apps similar to ours already exist, though they either are paid or simply to intimidating for new time users. Since you can connect with everyone from everywhere. Sometimes a global app isn't the best for such things. Our app aims to fix this. 

Future improvements: 1) Add an AI chatbox so that user can interact with the other AI profiles. 2) Create the Attendance filter 3) Fix bugs related to website, such as photos not matching age of person. Warpped photos. 4) Introduce variety. Not everyone wants a photo of themselves, so having a variety of pics can make the website feel more real.
